      <p>
        French Onion Soup We have been trying French onion soup in restaurants
        for years and my family and friends agree none can compare to my recipe
        for taste and simplicity of preparation.

          Add onions and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not
          brown the onions. Add beef broth, sherry and thyme. Season with salt
          and pepper, and simmer for 30 minutes.

          Heat the oven broiler. Ladle soup into oven safe serving bowls and
          place one slice of bread on top of each (bread may be broken into
          pieces if you prefer).

          Layer each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced
          Swiss and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Place bowls on cookie sheet
